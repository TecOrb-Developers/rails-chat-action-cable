 Why this specific session variable? Because Devise looks for this name
 Refer `after_sign_in_path_for(resource_or_scope)` method
 implementation and documentation at

  https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/v4.2.0/lib/devise/controllers/helpers.rb#L213

 and you should get it why.

  https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/v4.2.0/lib/devise/controllers/store_location.rb#L17
  https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/v4.2.0/lib/devise/controllers/store_location.rb#L54

 And `after_sign_in_path_for` method should come into picture when Client-app
 sends an authorization request to this Provider-app and the user is not
 found to be logged-in on the Provider-app. So Devise should throw
 the user to the Sign-in page and after successful sign-in user should
 be redirected to the Client-app. So we are storing the Client-app's
 path here in a session key supported by Devise in out-of-the-box fashion
 for handling redirects to original page after signing-in.

 So just setting this session variable Devise should handle the redirect
 to Client-app AFTER SUCCESSFUL SIGN-IN without any additional changes
 in it's SessionsController implementation.

 References:
  https://dev.mikamai.com/2015/02/11/oauth2-on-rails/
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/21632889/936494

 Note that if this session variable is NOT set then what would happen is
 that when user from Client-app sends authorization request and user
 is not NOT found logged-in by Devise on this Provider-app
 the Provider-app display's Sign Page but after successful login
 Provider-app doesn't redirect the logged-in user to Client-app.

 However that's not the case when user is found logged-in on this Provider-app
 In that case Provider-app displays the Authorize/Deny page facilitated
 by Doorkeeper. Clicking either on Authorize or Deny button the redirect
 happens!


 THIS SHOULD WORK ASSUMING YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY OVERRIDDEN

   after_sign_in_path_for(resource)`

 in your ApplicationController like following

   def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
     user_home_path
   end

 If that is the case then setting this session variable should have NO EFFECT.
 And to fix that you will need to do this

    def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
      stored_location_for(resource) || user_home_path
    end
